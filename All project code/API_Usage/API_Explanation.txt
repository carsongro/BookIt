API: https://openlibrary.org/dev/docs/api/books

The Open Library API provides access to information about books in its catalog. 
To look up a book we can use https://openlibrary.org/search.json?q=${search}
    Here, {$search} can be the book title or isbn number
    This search will create a json file of all the resulting books with the inputted title or isbn

ISBN:
An ISBN is a unique identifier that is used to track and manage books. 

This API call will return all instances that match the inputted string (including articles, audiobooks, movies, etc)
and so it is necessary to parse through the resulting json file and fetch all the info that is needed

This API does not provide information such as page number, weight, etc but it does provide author, image, publish date.
It is possible to get other information such as page number but you will have to use https://openlibrary.org/api/books
for example https://openlibrary.org/api/books?bibkeys=ISBN:9780980200447&jscmd=details&format=json will provide all information about the book "slow reading"
However, not all ISBN can work with this api call and some calls may result in an error or only provide limited information.
